# buzzG

buzzG adds a self-contained knowledge layer to a local [Buzz](https://github.com/block/buzz) deployment. Chat sessions are the primary knowledge container; people, agents, and uploaded documents are participants that contribute entries to one authoritative PostgreSQL schema. MinIO retains the original and normalized recovery artifacts, GCOR provides governed document retrieval, and [Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) builds the rebuildable temporal context graph through its MCP server.

Docker Compose starts Buzz, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, MinIO, Ollama, GCOR, FalkorDB, the upstream Graphiti MCP server, and a small PostgreSQL-to-MCP projector.

## What Runs Where

| Service | Host URL or port | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buzz relay | `ws://127.0.0.1:3000` | WebSocket endpoint for Buzz Desktop, `buzz-acp`, and other Buzz clients. |
| Relay health | `http://127.0.0.1:3000/_readiness` | Relay readiness check. The relay root (`/`) returns JSON metadata, not a web UI. |
| GCOR proxy | `http://127.0.0.1:5001` | HTTP ingestion, retrieval, collection, health, and metrics API. |
| GCOR health | `http://127.0.0.1:5001/health` | GCOR proxy health check. |
| GCOR MCP SSE | `http://127.0.0.1:8765/sse` | MCP endpoint for local MCP clients. |
| Graphiti MCP HTTP | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/` | Temporal entity, relationship, episode, and graph-search tools. |
| MinIO API | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` | S3-compatible object API. |
| MinIO console | `http://127.0.0.1:9001` | MinIO administration console. |

Buzz Desktop is the human-facing client. The relay does not expose the Buzz app at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`; visiting that URL returns the Nostr relay information document by design.

GCOR is not a Buzz channel bot. It is an ingestion/retrieval service. A Buzz agent can use it through MCP, or a Buzz workflow can send channel content to it automatically.

Component ownership is intentionally non-overlapping:

- PostgreSQL is authoritative for sessions, participants, normalized entries, document metadata, governance state, chunks, and projection status.
- MinIO is authoritative for original bytes plus Markdown and JSON recovery bundles.
- GCOR owns ingestion, governance, vector/full-text document retrieval, citations, and recovery.
- Graphiti owns entity extraction, relationship inference, temporal fact invalidation, episode provenance, and context-graph search.
- FalkorDB stores only Graphiti's rebuildable projection. Deleting it does not delete authoritative knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop running with Docker Compose v2.
- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7.
- A Buzz client such as Buzz Desktop, configured to use `ws://127.0.0.1:3000`.

## Start The Local Stack

1. Generate a local environment file. This creates stable local-only secrets:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/new-local-env.ps1
   ```

   If `.env` already exists and it is safe to replace every existing secret, run:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/new-local-env.ps1 -Force
   ```

2. In `.env`, ensure the public relay URL is set exactly as follows. Use forward slashes in a WebSocket URL:

   ```env
   RELAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:3000
   ```

   Keep `BUZZ_RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `BUZZ_GIT_HOOK_HMAC_SECRET`, database, Redis, S3, and ingestion secrets stable after the first startup. Replacing them can invalidate existing identities or stored credentials.

3. Build and start all services:

   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   For stack-only mode (recommended for production-like local runs), start with the override that removes host port publishing for GCOR proxy and MCP:

   ```powershell
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.stack-only.yml up -d --build
   ```

   On the first run, Ollama downloads `nomic-embed-text`, the normal generation model, and the Graphiti extraction model (`qwen2.5:7b` by default). Graphiti is built from the pinned upstream `v0.29.3` source. The first build and model download can take several minutes.

4. Check the service state:

   ```powershell
   docker compose ps
   curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:3000/_readiness
   curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:5001/health
   ```

   `gcor-migrate`, `minio-init`, and `ollama-init` are one-shot setup services and should show `Exited (0)`. The relay, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Ollama, GCOR, FalkorDB, Graphiti MCP, and both projectors should be running.

   In stack-only mode, `docker compose ps` should show no published host ports for `gcor-proxy` and `mcp-postgres-gcor`.

## Run Verification

Unit tests and rendered Compose validation run on every pull request. The CI
integration gate starts an isolated PostgreSQL, MinIO, GCOR, and deterministic
mock-inference stack, then verifies ingestion, deduplication, retrieval, and
immutable recovery records:

```powershell
docker compose -p gbuzz-integration -f docker-compose.integration.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from smoke smoke
docker compose -p gbuzz-integration -f docker-compose.integration.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

The integration stack uses port `15001`, isolated ephemeral storage, and no API
keys or downloaded language models. Keep the explicit `gbuzz-integration`
project name: it prevents the test services from colliding with a running Gbuzz
stack in the same directory. The Compose file also declares this name as a
second safeguard.

## Observe The Stack

The observability settings live in `.env`. Before first use, replace
`GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER` defaults to `admin`. Start or
update the application and monitoring containers together with:

```powershell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml --profile observability up -d --build
```

The profile creates Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, PostgreSQL exporter, and
Redis exporter containers. Grafana is available at `http://127.0.0.1:3001` and
uses the credentials from `GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER` and `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
Prometheus is at `http://127.0.0.1:9090`, and Alertmanager is at
`http://127.0.0.1:9093`.

Confirm the containers and Prometheus scrape targets after startup:

```powershell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml --profile observability ps
```

The provisioned Gbuzz dashboard covers target health, ingestion activity,
attachment failures, PostgreSQL connections, Redis memory, managed service
health, and automated recovery actions. Metrics and dashboard state persist in
named volumes across container recreation. Configure a deployment-specific
Alertmanager receiver before relying on notifications.

## Built-in Health Monitoring And Recovery

The default stack includes an independent `recovery-controller`. It polls the
Docker health state of explicitly labelled Gbuzz containers and exposes:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8082/health` | Controller and Docker inspection readiness. |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/status` | Read-only per-service health, policy, and last-action status. |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8082/metrics` | Prometheus recovery and service-health metrics. |

After three consecutive unhealthy observations, the controller may restart the
relay and stateless GCOR, MCP, and projector services. PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO,
Ollama, and FalkorDB are deliberately monitor-only. A five-minute per-service
cooldown and a default budget of three recovery actions per hour prevent restart
loops. Successful and failed decisions are appended to the persistent
`recovery-audit-data` volume, and the recent budget is restored after controller
restarts.

Inspect the current decision state with:

```powershell
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/status
docker compose exec recovery-controller tail -n 50 /var/lib/gbuzz-recovery/audit.jsonl
```

The controller mounts the Docker Engine socket, which is a privileged control
surface even when the filesystem mount is read-only. It has no mutation API or
general command runner: remediation is limited to immutable Compose labels. Do
not expose the controller publicly. For higher-assurance deployments, place a
restricted Docker socket proxy between the controller and the engine.

The GCOR MCP bridge exposes the same read-only assessment as
`get_stack_health`, allowing the Buzz SRE agent to inspect service state,
consecutive failures, recovery policy, and last actions without Docker or shell
access. Automated actions still come exclusively from the bounded controller.

## Automatic Stack Updates

Automatic updates are opt-in. The host-side updater pulls every configured
remote image tag, rebuilds all workspace-owned images with refreshed base
images, recreates the Compose stack in dependency order, and waits for every
long-running service to pass its health check. A named mutex prevents overlapping
runs, and results are appended to `backups/stack-update-audit.jsonl`.

Enable the scheduled updater in `.env`:

```env
AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED=true
AUTO_UPDATE_INCLUDE_OBSERVABILITY=false
AUTO_UPDATE_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

Test one update interactively before scheduling it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/update-stack.ps1 -Force
```

Install the Windows scheduled task (daily at 04:00 by default):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-auto-update-task.ps1
```

Choose another maintenance-window time or remove the task with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-auto-update-task.ps1 -DailyAt "02:30"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-auto-update-task.ps1 -Uninstall
```

The updater refreshes the image references already configured in Compose. A
fixed version or digest remains fixed; it is never silently rewritten to a new
release. This preserves the production lock-file contract. Review and update
version pins separately when adopting a new major or minor release. Stateful
data volumes are retained, but infrastructure backups should still run before
the maintenance window.

## Prepare A Reproducible Release

CI scans the repository for vulnerable dependencies and leaked secrets and
publishes an SPDX JSON SBOM artifact. For production, copy
`docker-compose.production.lock.example.yml` to the gitignored
`docker-compose.production.lock.yml`, replace every placeholder with an image
digest or commit-addressed Gbuzz image tag, and verify it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify-production-pins.ps1
```

To produce reviewable, hash-locked Python dependency files:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/update-python-locks.ps1
```

Review and commit the generated lock files. Application Docker builds and CI
install from them with pip's `--require-hashes` option; `requirements.txt`
remains the human-maintained dependency input.

## Connect Buzz Clients And Agents

Configure Buzz Desktop and any local Buzz agent harness with this endpoint:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:3000
```

For `buzz-acp` or another process that honors Buzz environment variables:

```powershell
$env:BUZZ_RELAY_URL = 'ws://127.0.0.1:3000'
```

The relay container is not itself an AI agent. If messages in Buzz channels do not receive responses, make sure a separate agent harness such as `buzz-acp` is running and connected to this same WebSocket URL.

## Ingest Content Through HTTP

The GCOR proxy accepts a multipart `POST /api/ingest` request. Supply exactly one of `file`, `text`, `file_url`, or `session_json`.

Optional metadata fields:

- `title`, `access_level`, `agent_id`, `source_uri`
- `channel_name`, `channel_id`
- `event_id`, `event_kind`, `event_timestamp`, `author_pubkey`
- `file_name` (for URL ingestion)
- `attachments_json` (JSON array of attachment objects containing `url`)
- `metadata_json` (extra JSON object merged into `gcor.documents.metadata`)

For chat-session replay, pass `session_json` as a JSON object matching [schemas/chat-session.schema.json](schemas/chat-session.schema.json). GCOR validates required fields, stores the raw JSON record, generates a Markdown envelope, indexes that envelope, and then replays attachment URLs into the same channel bucket.

You can fetch canonical examples directly from the proxy:

```powershell
curl.exe -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/examples/session-json
curl.exe -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/examples/markdown-envelope
```

These endpoints return schema path plus a validated example payload for client bootstrapping and integration tests.

If you pass `metadata_json` from PowerShell, put the JSON in a variable or here-string first so quoting stays valid.

When `channel_name` is provided, GCOR creates or reuses a MinIO bucket derived from the channel name and stores the object there. This enables per-channel object segregation for later lifecycle, ACL, or archival policies.

Read the local stack API secret from `.env` once per PowerShell session:

```powershell
$stackSecret = (Get-Content .env | Where-Object { $_ -match '^STACK_API_SECRET=' } | Select-Object -First 1) -replace '^STACK_API_SECRET=', ''
if (-not $stackSecret) {
   $stackSecret = (Get-Content .env | Where-Object { $_ -match '^INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=' } | Select-Object -First 1) -replace '^INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=', ''
}
```

When `ENFORCE_STACK_API_SECRET=true` (default), send `X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret` on all `/api/*` calls except `/health` and `/metrics`.

Ingest plain text:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ingest `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
  -F "text=The release cadence is every two weeks, with a freeze on Thursdays." `
  -F "title=Release cadence decision" `
  -F "access_level=public" `
  -F "source_uri=manual://release-cadence"
```

Ingest a chat session JSON record and replay embedded attachments:

```powershell
$session = @'
{
   "session_id": "session-001",
   "channel_name": "Architecture Review",
   "channel_id": "chan-42",
   "started_at": "2026-08-08T10:00:00Z",
   "messages": [
      {
         "message_id": "msg-1",
         "author_pubkey": "npub1...",
         "created_at": "2026-08-08T10:01:00Z",
         "content": "Please review the design notes.",
         "attachments": [
            {"url": "https://example.local/design-notes.md", "name": "design-notes.md"}
         ]
      }
   ]
}
'@

curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ingest `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -F "session_json=$session" `
   -F "access_level=public"
```

Ingest a PDF or text file:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ingest `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
  -F "file=@C:\path\to\report.pdf" `
  -F "title=Q4 report" `
  -F "access_level=public"
```

Ingest a file from a URL (for real-time workflow file events):

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ingest `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -F "file_url=https://example.local/path/spec.pdf" `
   -F "file_name=spec.pdf" `
   -F "channel_name=release-planning" `
   -F "event_id=abc123" `
   -F "event_timestamp=2026-08-07T10:15:00Z" `
   -F "source_uri=buzz://abc123" `
   -F "access_level=public"
```

Successful ingestion returns `document_id`, `record_id`, chunk count, the target `bucket`, and the keys for an immutable recovery bundle. Every message, uploaded file, attachment, curated item, and session now creates:

- `bundles/YYYY/MM/DD/<record-id>/original/<file>` containing the unchanged source bytes.
- `bundles/YYYY/MM/DD/<record-id>/content.md` containing normalized text and provenance front matter.
- `bundles/YYYY/MM/DD/<record-id>/record.json` containing schema-versioned lineage, checksums, scope, event metadata, and all object pointers.

Re-ingesting identical content in the same channel and access scope returns `deduplicated: true` rather than creating duplicate chunks, while retaining a separate immutable ingestion record. Identical content in another channel or access scope is deliberately isolated as a separate document identity.

When attachment replay is triggered, the response also includes `attachments_ingested` with per-URL status.

Knowledge approval and lifecycle changes also append immutable JSON events below `governance/<document-id>/events/` in the document's bucket. PostgreSQL remains the retrieval projection; the MinIO bundles retain the source and governance material required to audit or reconstruct it.

List recent recovery records through `GET /api/recovery/records`, or run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-recovery-audit.ps1
```

The audit output provides the original, Markdown, and JSON keys for each ingestion occurrence. Back up both the MinIO and PostgreSQL volumes; recovery bundles make the index reconstructable but do not replace infrastructure-level backups or retention policies.

Files are archived before extraction. If parsing or embedding fails, the API returns `quarantined: true` and still retains the original bytes, a diagnostic Markdown envelope, and a JSON record with the failure. Quarantined records can be reprocessed after an extractor is added without asking the user to upload the source again.

MinIO versioning is enabled automatically for GCOR-created buckets and the Buzz media bucket. Bundle and governance keys are unique and append-oriented, so an accidental overwrite or deletion remains recoverable through object versions.

### Legacy Backfill and Disaster Recovery

Preview and then apply bundle backfill for documents indexed before governed bundles were introduced:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-backfill.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-backfill.ps1 -Apply
```

Validate all MinIO manifests, or reconstruct missing Postgres documents, chunks, embeddings, graph edges, ingestion occurrences, quarantined records, and governance metadata:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-restore.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-restore.ps1 -Apply
```

The restore operation is additive and idempotent; it does not delete existing rows. For a full disaster-recovery test, point a temporary GCOR proxy at an empty migrated database and run the command with `-Apply`.

### Automatic Buzz Capture

The `gcor-event-projector` service starts with the stack and reads the relay's signed, append-only event table without modifying it. It automatically captures message kinds `9`, `40002`, `45001`, and `45003`, derives channel visibility and author identity from trusted relay data, downloads `imeta` attachments through the internal relay address, and records durable processing checkpoints in `gcor.event_projection`.

This replaces the need to install the example workflow for standard message and file capture. The workflow template remains available for deployments that prefer explicit workflow routing. Configure projector behavior with `PROJECTOR_EVENT_KINDS`, `PROJECTOR_POLL_SECONDS`, and `PROJECTOR_BATCH_SIZE`.

### Local Grounded Generation

`/api/ask` and `/api/ask/reply` use the local `GENERATION_MODEL` through Ollama to synthesize an evidence-only answer with inline numbered citations. If generation is unavailable, the endpoints retain their previous ranked-excerpt response, preserving API availability and compatibility. The default local model is `qwen2.5:1.5b`.

Attachment replay uses retry with exponential backoff and timeout controls:

```env
ATTACHMENT_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=20
ATTACHMENT_FETCH_MAX_RETRIES=2
ATTACHMENT_FETCH_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS=0.5
ATTACHMENT_FETCH_RETRY_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS=8
```

For production hardening of `file_url` and attachment replay URLs, enable remote fetch policy controls:

```env
MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_REQUEST=100
REMOTE_FETCH_ALLOWED_HOSTS=raw.githubusercontent.com,files.example.com,*.cdn.example.com
REMOTE_FETCH_BLOCK_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true
```

- `MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_REQUEST` limits replay fan-out per ingest call.
- `REMOTE_FETCH_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (optional) restricts URL ingestion to trusted hosts.
- `REMOTE_FETCH_BLOCK_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true` blocks hosts that resolve to private, loopback, link-local, reserved, multicast, or unspecified IP addresses.

Replay metrics exported at `/metrics`:

- `gcor_attachment_replay_attempts_total`
- `gcor_attachment_replay_retries_total`
- `gcor_attachment_replay_failures_total`
- `gcor_attachment_replay_timeouts_total`
- `gcor_attachment_fetch_duration_seconds`
- `gcor_remote_fetch_blocked_total{reason=...}`

## Retrieve Indexed Content

Query the semantic index with `POST /api/retrieve`:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/retrieve `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"query":"What is the release cadence?","top_k":8,"hops":2,"access_level":"public"}'
```

`top_k` controls how many results are returned. `hops` controls graph expansion from matching chunks; use `0` for search only. Results contain `chunks`, `graph_nodes`, and a `reflection` value of `graph`, `chunks`, or `empty`. Each returned chunk includes `vector_score`, `lexical_score`, and the combined `score`.

Every successful ingestion also writes to `gcor.knowledge_sessions`, `gcor.knowledge_participants`, and `gcor.knowledge_entries`. Messages become user or agent contributions. Uploaded files become `document` participants; each document chunk is a bounded, provenance-bearing contribution to the same session. `gcor.graphiti_projection` records delivery state and reconciles Graphiti's minted episode UUID back to the authoritative entry after background processing.

The Graphiti projector sends the common JSON schema in `schemas/session-knowledge-entry.schema.json` through the upstream MCP `add_memory` tool. It probes the live tool schema, supplies `reference_time`, groups episodes by session, and uses `get_episodes` to reconcile generated identifiers. It allows one globally in-flight extraction at a time because Graphiti only serializes work inside each group; this prevents many sessions from overwhelming limited local hardware. Accepted work that never becomes queryable is retried after `GRAPHITI_PROJECTOR_SUBMISSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`, up to the configured attempt limit. Query Graphiti directly through tools such as `search_nodes`, `search_memory_facts`, `get_episodes`, and `get_episode_entities`.

Inspect delivery state independently of core service health:

```powershell
curl.exe -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/graphiti/status
```

`in_flight` should never exceed one. `dead_letter` must be zero before a production release; failed entries remain in PostgreSQL and can be safely replayed because FalkorDB is a derived projection.

Inspect the four release-blocking backlog classes and fail closed unless all are zero:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/graphiti-projection-release-gate.ps1
```

For historical failures, reconcile already-created Graphiti episodes first and requeue at most ten projection records in one operator action (exhausted rows have their projection-attempt budget reset):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/graphiti-projection-replay.ps1 -Limit 10
```

The replay command only updates `gcor.graphiti_projection`; it never changes authoritative sessions, participants, entries, documents, ingestion records, or recovery objects. Repeat bounded batches while observing the projector, then rerun the release gate.

### Production Graphiti inference

Local Compose remains fully self-contained and uses Ollama. On hardware that cannot run reliable temporal extraction, use the production override to send Graphiti LLM and embedding requests to OpenAI while retaining PostgreSQL, pgvector, MinIO, Graphiti MCP, and FalkorDB locally:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "..."
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --build
```

The production default embedding model is `text-embedding-3-small` with 1536 dimensions. The API key is required at Compose interpolation time and must not be committed. Local and production Graphiti embeddings have different dimensions; after a mode change, rebuild the FalkorDB Graphiti projection from authoritative PostgreSQL rather than mixing vectors in one graph. This override changes Graphiti inference only; GCOR's PostgreSQL `pgvector` index retains its independently configured embedding model and dimension.

Retrieval uses normalized weights of `0.75` for vector similarity and `0.25` for full-text rank by default. Override them per request when a query requires more exact-keyword matching:

```json
{
   "query": "exact project code or release number",
   "top_k": 8,
   "vector_weight": 0.4,
   "lexical_weight": 0.6
}
```

List indexed document collections and inspect service health:

```powershell
curl.exe -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/collections
curl.exe http://127.0.0.1:5001/health
curl.exe -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/capabilities
```

`/api/capabilities` reports whether `pgvector`, Apache AGE, and pgvectorscale are enabled or available in the current database image. The supplied `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` image enables `pgvector`; Apache AGE and pgvectorscale are intentionally not installed because neither package is available in that pinned image. The current relational graph plus recursive CTE traversal remains the active graph backend.

## Chat-Native Knowledge Loop

GCOR now supports a direct ask/promote/correct loop intended for Buzz-first interaction:

- `POST /api/ask` returns a grounded answer plus citations from indexed chunks.
- `POST /api/ask/reply` returns a workflow-friendly reply envelope (`reply.text`) for in-channel posting.
- `POST /api/knowledge/promote` stores a curated text artifact as durable knowledge.
- `POST /api/knowledge/correct` stores a correction and links it to a target document (`CONTRADICTS` edge).
- `POST /api/knowledge/approve` transitions proposed knowledge into approved state.
- `POST /api/knowledge/transition` updates lifecycle state (`approved`, `superseded`, `archived`, `rejected`, `proposed`).

`/api/ask` and `/api/ask/reply` now enforce channel scoping. Provide at least one of `channel_id` or `channel_name`.
`/api/ask` and `/api/ask/reply` default to `approved_only=true`, so proposed knowledge is hidden until approved.
`/api/ask` and `/api/ask/reply` also default to `prefer_recent_approved=true`, which boosts newer approved knowledge over older approved entries.

Ask example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ask `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"query":"what was decided for release cadence?","top_k":6,"hops":1,"access_level":"public","channel_id":"chan-1","channel_name":"release-planning"}'
```

Promote example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/knowledge/promote `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"title":"Release cadence decision","content":"We ship every two weeks with Thursday freeze.","source_uri":"buzz://msg-123","channel_name":"release-planning","channel_id":"chan-1","access_level":"public"}'
```

Correct example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/knowledge/correct `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"target_source_uri":"buzz://msg-123","correction_text":"Freeze moved from Thursday to Wednesday.","source_uri":"buzz://msg-456","channel_name":"release-planning","channel_id":"chan-1","access_level":"public"}'
```

Approve example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/knowledge/approve `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"target_source_uri":"buzz://msg-123","approved_by":"npub1admin","note":"Reviewed and approved"}'
```

Supersede example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/knowledge/transition `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"transition":"superseded","target_source_uri":"buzz://msg-123","superseded_by_source_uri":"buzz://msg-789","changed_by":"npub1admin","note":"Replaced by newer canonical note"}'
```

Archive example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/knowledge/transition `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"transition":"archived","target_source_uri":"buzz://msg-123","changed_by":"npub1admin","note":"No longer relevant"}'
```

Run an end-to-end lifecycle smoke test (promote, approve, supersede, archive, and scoped ask checks):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-knowledge-smoke.ps1
```

Emit CI-friendly JSON output with exit code semantics (`0` on pass, `1` on failure):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-knowledge-smoke.ps1 -Json
```

Run the same check from VS Code:

```text
Task: GCOR: Knowledge Smoke Test
```

Run a stricter regression gate that creates an isolated channel per run and enforces exact citation expectations:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-knowledge-gate.ps1 -Json
```

Use lenient mode if your environment intentionally includes extra matching citations:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-knowledge-gate.ps1 -Json -AllowExtraCitations
```

VS Code task for the strict gate:

```text
Task: GCOR: Knowledge Regression Gate
```

Optional overrides:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/gcor-knowledge-smoke.ps1 `
   -BaseUrl http://127.0.0.1:5001 `
   -ChannelId chan-lifecycle-smoke `
   -ChannelName lifecycle-smoke `
   -ApprovedBy npub1admin
```

Ask-reply envelope example:

```powershell
curl.exe -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ask/reply `
   -H "X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret: $stackSecret" `
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
   -d '{"query":"/ask what is release cadence?","top_k":6,"hops":1,"max_citations":4,"channel_id":"chan-1","channel_name":"release-planning","source_event_id":"msg-999"}'
```

The response includes `reply.text`, which can be posted back to the channel by your workflow runner.

## Use GCOR From An MCP Agent

The MCP server exposes these core tools:

- `ingest_document` ingests text or base64-encoded UTF-8 content, and can also carry channel, event, file, and structured metadata fields to match the HTTP ingest API.
- `semantic_search` performs vector retrieval without graph expansion.
- `graph_expand` performs retrieval plus bounded graph expansion.
- `ask_knowledge` returns grounded answers and citations from GCOR.
- `ask_knowledge_reply` returns a posting-friendly reply envelope for chat workflows.
- `list_knowledge_sessions` lists the authoritative session containers and projection counts.
- `get_knowledge_session` returns one session with its user, agent, system, and document participants and ordered entries.
- `promote_knowledge` stores curated channel knowledge as durable memory.
- `correct_knowledge` records corrections linked to existing knowledge targets.
- `approve_knowledge` marks proposed knowledge as approved for default ask visibility.
- `transition_knowledge` applies lifecycle transitions including supersede/archive/reject.

For `ask_knowledge` and `ask_knowledge_reply`, pass `channel_id` or `channel_name` so retrieval is constrained to the channel scope.

For a local desktop MCP client, register this SSE endpoint:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/sse
```

Register Graphiti independently using streamable HTTP:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/
```

Agents should use GCOR MCP for governed ingestion, lifecycle operations, document retrieval, and citations. They should use Graphiti MCP for temporal facts, entity relationships, episode history, and graph-native context queries.

The repository includes the corresponding VS Code MCP configuration in [.vscode/mcp.json](.vscode/mcp.json). From an agent running inside the Docker Compose network, use `http://mcp-postgres-gcor:8765/sse` instead.

Registering MCP tools makes GCOR available to an agent; it does not create a visible `gcore-bot` or `gcor-bot` user in Buzz. Create and operate a dedicated Buzz agent identity if a channel-visible ingestion bot is required.

## Automatically Index Buzz Messages

[example-buzz-workflow.gcor-ingest.yml](example-buzz-workflow.gcor-ingest.yml) is a workflow template intended to forward channel discussions and uploaded files to GCOR in near real time. It is not automatically installed by Docker Compose.

[example-buzz-workflow.gcor-knowledge.yml](example-buzz-workflow.gcor-knowledge.yml) is a companion template for chat-native ask/promote/correct interactions.

`example-buzz-workflow.gcor-knowledge.yml` includes an `/approve` path for two-step knowledge governance.

[example-buzz-workflow.gcor-ask-reply.yml](example-buzz-workflow.gcor-ask-reply.yml) demonstrates a two-step ask-and-post pattern: call `POST /api/ask/reply`, then send `reply.text` back to the same channel.

Before installing it in your Buzz deployment:

1. Adapt the `on` trigger names and `${event.*}` fields to the workflow schema supported by the deployed Buzz version.
2. Set the workflow secret variable named `GCOR_STACK_API_SECRET` to the value of `STACK_API_SECRET` in `.env` (or `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if you intentionally keep one shared secret).
3. Confirm the workflow runner can reach `http://gcor-proxy:5001/api/ingest` on the Compose network. If it runs on the Windows host instead, use `http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/ingest`.
4. Ensure the event payload fields used by the template exist in your Buzz version, especially `channel_name`, `channel_id`, `file_url`, `attachments`, and `created_at`.
5. Send a test message and upload a test file in a channel, then confirm entries appear at `/api/collections` and in the corresponding channel-derived MinIO bucket.

The workflow stores every forwarded event using `access_level: public`. Review that policy before enabling automatic indexing on channels that may contain restricted content.

## Embedding Configuration

The default configuration uses local Ollama embeddings:

```env
EMBEDDING_BACKEND=ollama
EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
EMBEDDING_DIMS=768
```

To use OpenAI embeddings instead, set all of the following and recreate the GCOR proxy:

```env
EMBEDDING_BACKEND=openai
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
EMBEDDING_DIMS=1536
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

Changing `EMBEDDING_DIMS` after documents have been indexed requires a deliberate schema migration and re-ingestion; do not change it casually on an active collection.

The Compose initializer downloads the configured model before `gcor-proxy` starts. Confirm it is available with:

```powershell
docker compose exec ollama ollama list
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check and resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `http://127.0.0.1:3000` shows JSON | Expected. It is relay metadata, not the Buzz application. Use Buzz Desktop with `ws://127.0.0.1:3000`. |
| Relay restarts continuously | Run `docker compose logs relay`. Confirm `BUZZ_RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY` and `BUZZ_GIT_HOOK_HMAC_SECRET` are valid 64-character hexadecimal values. |
| GCOR proxy is not running | Run `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs gcor-proxy ollama-init`. The proxy waits for `ollama-init` to pull the configured embedding model. |
| `POST /api/ingest` or `/api/ask` returns `401` | Send `X-Gcor-Webhook-Secret` with `STACK_API_SECRET` (or `INGEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` when shared) from `.env`. |
| Retrieval is empty | Ingest content first, use the same `access_level` used at ingestion, and check `GET /api/collections`. |
| Ingestion returns an Ollama error | Run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate ollama-init`, wait for it to exit with code `0`, then run `docker compose exec ollama ollama list`. The configured embedding model must be listed. |
| Agents do not respond in Buzz | The relay is not an agent. Start the agent harness and configure its `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` as `ws://127.0.0.1:3000`. |
| GCOR tools do not appear to an agent | Confirm the client is connected to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/sse` and the MCP server is up with `docker compose ps mcp-postgres-gcor`. |

## Stop Or Reset

Stop services while preserving all data:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

To remove the containers and persistent local data, including the relay database, indexed documents, MinIO data, Git data, and downloaded Ollama models:

```powershell
docker compose down --volumes
```

## Security Notes

The Compose setup is intended for local development. The proxy enforces the caller-supplied `access_level` and optional `agent_id` filters during retrieval, but an untrusted API caller can choose those fields. For production, keep the GCOR proxy and MCP server on a private network, use strong stable secrets, terminate public access at a dedicated ingress layer, and derive ACL fields from trusted Buzz identity rather than from caller-controlled request data.
